## Usage

### Connecting from MCP Clients

Once installed and started, the MCP server is available at:
```
http://homeassistant.local:6789/api/mcp
```

### Example Client Configuration

**For Claude Code CLI:**
```bash
# Without API key (use IP address if homeassistant.local doesn't resolve)
claude mcp add ha-files http://homeassistant.local:6789/api/mcp --transport http
# or
claude mcp add ha-files http://192.168.1.93:6789/api/mcp --transport http

# With API key
claude mcp add ha-files "http://homeassistant.local:6789/api/mcp?code=YOUR_API_KEY" --transport http
```

**Note:** The `--transport http` flag is required for Claude Code CLI to properly recognize this as an HTTP-based MCP server.

- `include_services` (boolean, default: false): Include services in response

**Example Usage:**
```
# Get first 10 devices
list_ha_entities_devices(limit=10, include_entities=false)

# Get all lights
list_ha_entities_devices(domain_filter="light", limit=100)

# Search for bedroom entities
list_ha_entities_devices(entity_filter="bedroom", limit=20)

# Get next page of results
list_ha_entities_devices(limit=50, offset=50)
