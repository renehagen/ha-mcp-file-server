## Usage

### Connecting from MCP Clients

Once installed and started, the MCP server is available at:
```
http://homeassistant.local:6789/api/mcp
```

### Example Client Configuration

**For Claude Code CLI:**
```bash
# Without API key (use IP address if homeassistant.local doesn't resolve)
claude mcp add ha-files http://homeassistant.local:6789/api/mcp --transport http
# or
claude mcp add ha-files http://192.168.1.93:6789/api/mcp --transport http

# With API key
claude mcp add ha-files "http://homeassistant.local:6789/api/mcp?code=YOUR_API_KEY" --transport http
```

**Note:** The `--transport http` flag is required for Claude Code CLI to properly recognize this as an HTTP-based MCP server.

**For Claude Desktop or other MCP clients:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ha-files": {
      "transport": {
        "type": "http", 
        "url": "http://homeassistant.local:6789/api/mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Tools

- `list_directory`: List files and directories in a path
- `read_file`: Read contents of a file
- `write_file`: Write content to a file
- `create_directory`: Create a new directory
- `delete_path`: Delete a file or directory
- `search_files`: Search for files containing specific text
- `read_file_filtered`: Read file with filtering support for large files
- `execute_ha_cli`: Execute Home Assistant CLI commands (when enabled)

### Home Assistant CLI Commands

When `enable_ha_cli` is set to `true`, the server provides a secure way to execute Home Assistant CLI commands. This feature includes:

**Safety Features:**
- Only specific HA CLI commands are allowed (ha addons, ha supervisor, ha core, etc.)
- Dangerous patterns are blocked (file operations, system commands, shell injection)
- Commands have a timeout limit (default 30 seconds)
- Output is limited to 1MB to prevent resource exhaustion

**Allowed Commands:**
- `ha addons` - Manage add-ons (logs, info, stats, etc.)
- `ha supervisor` - Supervisor information and operations
- `ha core` - Home Assistant core operations
- `ha host` - Host system information
- `ha network` - Network configuration
- `ha os` - Operating system operations
- `ha audio` - Audio system management
- `ha multicast` - Multicast DNS operations
- `ha dns` - DNS configuration
- `ha jobs` - View running jobs
- `ha resolution` - View system resolution issues
- `ha info` - General system information
- `ha --help` - Help information

**Example Usage:**
```
execute_ha_cli("ha addons logs core_matter_server")
execute_ha_cli("ha supervisor info")
execute_ha_cli("ha core logs")
```

**Security Note:** HA CLI access is disabled by default. Only enable it if you need command-line access to your Home Assistant system and understand the security implications.
